This is a very simple daemon that reads the pflog device of your choice, (or
pflog0 if not specified) formats it somewhat more human-readably and pushes
this to the syslog LOG_NOTICE facility.

Things I still might implement:
	- custom filter expressions to pcap

I make no guarantees for ever implementing this.
