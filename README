pfloggerd -- a pflog to syslog bridge by Staffan Thomén <duck@shangtai.net>

This is a very simple daemon that reads the pflog device of your choice, (or
pflog0 if not specified) formats it somewhat more human-readably and pushes
this to the syslog LOG_NOTICE facility.

TODO:
 - custom filter expressions to pcap

What's new in 1.1
=================
 * -i flag actually works
 * -p flag for creating a pidfile (rc.d usage)
 * A message is now sent to syslog in case the daemon quits due to an error
   from pcap_loop()
 * Minor tweaks
